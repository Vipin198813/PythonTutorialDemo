"""Datatype of a variable - Type of value a variable holds
e.g: a = 5
Proper Operations can be performed.
Proper memory utilization
# Data types example: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary, String, int, float, complex, NoneType, Boolean
Data Type:
1) Based on nature of the value:
       - Numeric
            a) integer: 2,5,7
            b) float:   2.50
            c) complex:  2+ 3j
       - Sequential:
            a) tuple = (3,44,354534)
            b) list = [2,43,67]
            c) string = "safdsdf"
       - Boolean:
            a) True
            b) false
       - NoneType Datatype:
            None - Current no value in the variable and in future when ever we want we can assign a data type to this variable.
       - Set:
            a) set - unordered and mutable
            b) frozen set - unordered  and immutable
       - Mapping:
            a) Dictionary = Key and value pair - {key,value} e.g: a = {"a": 5}

2) Ordered/Sequence or Unordered
        Ordered - Data stored in the same order as they are stored.
                - Can be accessed using Index value
                e.g: List, Tuple, String
        UnOrdered - Order is not maintained
                  - Cannot access through index value
                  e.g: Set, Dictionary
3) Mutability / Immutability
            Mutable - Stored data can be changed later e.g: List, Dictionary, Set
            Immutable - Stored data cannot be changed later e.g: String, Tuple, Boolean
