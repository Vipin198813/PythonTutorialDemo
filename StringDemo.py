1. What is string:
        String is a sequence of characters. We have to use double inverted commas on both side, then only the word is considered as string.
2. How to create string:
        single_quote = 'Welcome to Python'
        double_quote = 'Welcome to Pythin'
        tripe_quote = '''welcome to python'''
3. Features of String:
        Immutable - Once string is created, its content cannot be changed or modified.
        Ordered - Strings are ordered, which means that the order of the characters in string is maintained.
        Sequence - Strings are considered sequence of characters i.e. they are an ordered collection of elements.
4. Indexing and Slicing
        a) Indexing: fetch only one element at a time.
            Forward Indexing - From left to right indexing (0 to ...)
            Backward indexing - Right to Left indexing (-1 to ...)
        b) Slicing: fetches one or more elements from the string.
                [start, End, Gap]  e.g: [0, 5, 2]
