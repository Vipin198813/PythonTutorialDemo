""" Operators = Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Operations:
  Arithmetic Operators: Mathematical Calculations
        a+b, a-b, a*b, a%b, a/b, a//b, a**b
  Assignment Operators: Variable based operations
        Uses: Store, increment, conditional and loop
        Operators : =, +=, -=, *=
  Comparison Operators: Comparison
        <, >, >=, <=, !=, ==
  Logical Operators: Decision based on multiple conditions
        AND, OR, NOT
  Bitwise Operators: Binary Operations
  Identity Operators: Memory Operations
        If we want to compare values then we can use '=='
        If we want to compare address of the objects then we can use 'is, is not'
  Membership Operators: Element /  Value based on presence or absence operations
        IN, NOT IN """
